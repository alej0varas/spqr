This is a list of the immediate issues that I have with SPQR (as of v0.2.9),
and the ones I shall be fixing first:

1: After selecting new, you are told that k brings up a key list. It doesn't.
   *DONE*

2: Clicking on a menu item activates the code, but the menu is not cleared
   from the screen until AFTER the routine has finished (and also goes
   funny on preferences menu)
   *DONE*

2b:Add a link from the pygame image on intro screen
   *DONE*
   
Currently:
Firstly make the map and unit info link up better
	*DONE*
Each individual/city/unit to have a unique id to identify it
	*DONE*
Never pass an index: pass the id number
	*Mainly done* - not always done to ensure speed.
	In future - all data that needs to be stored will use the id number
Allow 4 units on each hex
	*DONE*
Code now shows these units below
	*DONE*
Allow user to select a unit from the info box
	*DONE*
Add a 'm' key - moves to next unit on same hex
	*DONE*
Allow units to move
	*DONE*
Tidy up visually (2c and 2d)
	*DONE*
Put an option of 'new game' in file menu
	*DONE*

13 Sep 06 - Seems that the structure for 4 units/hex seems to work 

Known Bugs:
Still possible to move to below the max hex (bottom y co-ord)
The mini-map click is not accurate
When you move *away* from a hex, you'll need to redraw the hex you left
if it now only has 1 unit in it
	*DONE*
Flashing unit overwrites star overlay on surrounding hexes - fix
	*DONE*

2c: Add movement left to unit overlay graphics
	*DONE*

2d: Add 'extra units' overlay on map
	*DONE*

Add music
	*DONE*
Make preference screen work for volume + music options
	*DONE*
Enable click dragging for mini-map
	*DONE*

Add a 'c' key - centre map on current unit (if highlighted)
	*DONE*
Add individuals to dataset, parser and scenario file
	*DONE*

Tidy up some of the window code to ensure we don't reproduce code
	I.e. the loop at the end of EVERY window creation code that
	offsets all of the widgets etc...
	*DONE*
Make it so that the area asked for, when you ask for a window, is
	actually that area, so that the window itself is slightly larger
	*DONE*
4: Need to resolve more than 1 unit on screen at once. Possible: reduce size
   of info bars, get rid of i button, allow max of n units on 1 hex
   (possibly 4 - that would be an army of 96,000 men)
	*DONE*

5: Allow left click drag on mini map
	*DONE*

==============================================
==28th October 2006===========================
==============================================
	
Allow double-clicks (*ouch*).
	*DONE*
Add a 'display units' window, which lists the units like the
  cities in civ
  *DONE*
Do the same for the cities
	*DONE*
And for the individuals
	*DONE*
Show turns left on unit list dialog
	*DONE*
Fix 'window top left not showing' bug
	*DONE*
Make the keypress code pass the handle parameter on an event
	*DONE* - or at least the skeleton for it (not useful yet?)
Standardise the placement of buttons and seperators at the bottom
  of all dialogs and windows
  *DONE*
Add owner to unit info boxes
	*DONE*
Draw mini graph on stacked units images
	*DONE*
Make the console screen 1:work, 2:do something useful
	*DONE*
Remove silly i icon and show info on icon double-click
	*DONE*
Tidy up the bottom info display a *lot*. Get rid of the i graphic
	*DONE*
Diffrentiate between the different stacked units
	*DONE*

==============================================
===2nd November 2006==========================
==============================================

Add a listbox widget (ouch). Used for battle code
	*DONE*
Make the unit list dialog more interactive
Show a loading screen during start-up
	*DONE*
Highlight the current unit in the section left of the mini-map
	*DONE*
Fix left click position on mini-map (not accurate)
	*DONE*
FIX THE FUCKING MAP LAYOUT - YOU CAN CRASH THE GAME IN NORTH AFRICA!!!
Move to a CVS database, or something like it

Add individuals to the code. Make them *very* simple for now
	(i.e. they actually do something, and play the game)

Split the battle code *away* from the AI code.

Make the AI code do something (retreat at sign of attack, retire
  to a sensible hex)

3: Battle code badly needs to be finished. We need:
	a: An agression meter of some kind
	b: The ability to select what you want to go for/defend
	c: Enemy units to retreat
	d: The numbers to look better
	e: It should work with cities

----------------------------------------------
Back to work on Dec 6th 2006:

Remove all battle code.
	*DONE*
Seperate all animation code away from movement area
	*DONE*
Build a general 'animate unit' routine
	*DONE*
Make a *very* simple battle routine: just a simple messagebox with results
Make the loser retreat away
Make battles for cities a bit more complex (but not a lot)

NOT EASY: update maps with color overlay to show territory controlled
	(*OUCH!!* - but it'll get done)

----------------------------------------------
Back to work on Tuesday 6th March
Previous 'back to work' was pretty short

Aims:

Finish off the battle code so a simple battle system is coherent and works
Make it work with cities as well
Add color overlay to the graphics

==============================================
===Serious - almost a release!================
==============================================

Give individuals named jobs, add a fair few of them

Enhance individiual itemlist window, so you can cut down
  those highlighted (important jobs only, maybe)

At start of game turn, allow to select individual to play

Play as that individual

Add a whole bunch of sound effects

Add a navy, and ports, and a seperate 'SR' move at the very
  start of the turn (make this pretty simple)
  
==============================================
===This is most definitly a release!==========
==============================================
  
Add a 'goto' interface, that uses an A* routine and can handle
  moves over multiple turns (small ouch)

6: Add VERY basic economic system, and add to end of turn

7: Allow loading and saving of game. Make this very simple to start with
   (choose between various slots)

10: Add some simple A.I. for the enemy, and give them a turn

At this point you have a semi-playable game. Ok, it'll suck, but you can
possibly get some other people in at this point.

Add weights to each map index, so it costs more to move in some
  areas than others, and indicate this graphically (*OUCH*)

Economic System:

There are several things traded in SPQR.

Foreign trade is in:
Amber - Free Germany
Ivory - Tropical Africa
Incense - Arabia
Pepper - India
Silk - China

Other trade is in the following items:
Bronze
Iron -> Weapons
Silver
Gold
Grain
Oil
Flax -> Cloth
Hemp -> Cloth
Slaves

We use the city as the basic economic unit
Each hex attached to a city (EXCEPT that of the city itself) has a production
value for all of the above. This is the EXCESS produce, or if negative, the NEED
that a city has. If a city has a shortfall in food, expect problems (normally, cities
are *not* short on food).

It is not profitable in any way to export food over land to anything more than 2 hexes
away, the only option is by sea. In fact almost all major movement of goods must be done
by sea. The cost of transportation is taken as largly static (a function of distance).

The following taxes can be implemented:

A tax on goods, as a percentage (i.e. a sales tax). This is on named goods.
A border collection tax, when goods move in or out the Roman border.
