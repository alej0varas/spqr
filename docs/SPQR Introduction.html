<span style="font-weight: bold;">SPQR - An Introduction.</span><br>
<br>
SPQR is one mans attempt to produce a digital sandbox of the Roman
empire, from around 300 BC to approx 500 AD. It's stated aim is the
rather optimistic<br>
<br>
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">'SPQR
should aspire
to be so good that any other attempt at a similar game would be
pointless - SPQR will already be better'<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">This is
rather a bold claim, as I'm sure you'll agree. So let's first look at
the aims of SPQR are, and then look at how that influenced some of the
technical design. The former can be listed:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">1: <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPQR
should be as historically accurate as possible.</span></span><br>

When I started to think about programming a strategy game, I thought
first of writing a WWII game, mainly because I had been highly
influenced by the brilliant board game Third Reich. My thought was to
write such a game for my computer, but I could do it much better
because the computer could look after all the tricky book-keeping. Of
course, historical accuracy was also my aim - but this brings problems
beacuse, quite simply, WWII is a very well studied piece of history.
There would be far too many facts to fit into the game. Perhaps it
would confine me as a designer. Anyhow, this problem had me stunped for
a while, until I read the most excellent Tacitus: Annals of Imperial
Rome. Here was a subject that I could cover because, paradoxically, it
is less well known! Now, this isn't to mean that I want to be less
accurate, it's just that in the nature of things a certain level of
accuracy will always be out of reach, due to the ravages of time. Let
me give a concrete example: if I am writing the economic code for a
game, then I would have to study an awful lot of data to make the game
work, and feel right in a modern setting. In the ancient world, it is
fair to say that the data, actual numbers, are very few and far
between, and thus easier to simulate. This lack of data actually frees
the coder, and makes the job easier.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just add that that doesn't mean that apples
can be oranges: if a fact is known about the Romans, then I shall
certainly try and add it into the game. </span><span

<span style="font-style: italic;">2: <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPQR
should be playable</span></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any complex game with inspirations must not also
forget what it is: a game. If you can't sit down and enjoy it, then
you've failed.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">3: <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPQR
is strategic, not tactical</span></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll not see fields of 3d soldiers, animated in
fantastic battle scenes. Other games can do that stuff. SPQR is to be
like a complicated chess game, purely turn based and not real time at
all.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">4: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Depth
comes as standard</span></span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every unit in the game will develop a history:
people mentioned will marry, die and have offspring: every gold piece
will be accounted for.<br>
<br>
So you seen what some of the goals are in SPQR. How do I plan to make
this all work?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">1: <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPQR
is written in Python</span></span><br>
</span>

Years ago, I wrote graphical demos in whizz-bang assembly language. I
was the king of the look-up table, and I could shave 0.000000565 of a
second from a tight loop by knowing fast ways of making the acumulator
set to 0. I've spent years coding in C/C++, and in fact I have another
project which involves coding the fastest virtual machine I can do. So,
given all that experience, why use Python? I will grant you it's
probably the slowest language out there, but the key selling point to
me is expressive power. I can produce code that does things very much
quicker in Python than in C, and if SPQR is ever to become a reality
then I need
to ouput code at a fair speed, because surely I will need a lot of it
and I don't see any other coders helping me yet.</span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">2: <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPQR
uses pygame</span></span><br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, this one might be less logical. If I used Python because it's
easier to build quickly, then why not use PyGTK, or perhaps PyQT to
build the gui? I researched this point at length because it was bound
to influence the game. The basic points were 2, mainly: if I wrote the
game with a gui kit, then I would have easy gui production, but much
more limited access over how the game looked, and how the graphics were
displayed to the screen. If I used a game library, then I had fantastic
access to exactly how the game looked, but no gui stuff. In the end, it
came down to what I liked about the libraries: and pygame is both 'good
enough' for the job, and small enough to remain in ones head as you
code. The fact that I use python means that coding up that gui was less
painfull than I thought though.</span><br>

 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">No 3D graphics</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These have been all the rage for a good few years
now, but I can't see what they add apart from eye candy.<br>
