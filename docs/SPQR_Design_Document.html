SPQR Design Spec</span></big><br>








<br>








This document is the formal design specification for SPQR, a turn-based
strategy game written in Python and using the Pygame library.<br>








The bulk of this document is split into 3 sections. The first sets out
what may be termed the axioms of SPQR; that is, what SPQR aims to be
and how it aims to get there. The second section describes a road map
to how the current code is moving along. The third section describes
how the game mechanics work.<br>








<br style="font-weight: bold;">








<span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic Axioms of SPQR</span><br>








<br>








1: SPQR uses Python + Pygame, nothing else<br>








2: Aim to be historically accurate at all times<br>








3: Don't force micro-management<br>








4: Should be enjoyable and informative<br>








<br>








<span style="font-weight: bold;">Code Road Map</span><br>








<br>








The current TODO list boils down to this:<br>








<br>








Clear up the clutter in the spqr_data.py module.<br>








Enable movement on a laptop.<br>








Enable movement with just a mouse.<br>








Clear some minor menu issues (port bug solutions from HandyGUI).<br>








Make the battles work.<br>








Enable battles with cities.<br>








Color the regions of empires.<br>








<br>








<br>








<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">SPQR Design</span><br>








<br>

Before I go into detail about the various features of SPQR, I wil first
outline how the game will work. Note that this is not to make every
game the same, but it will show some features of how the game should
play.<br>

<br>

Firstly, SPQR tends to move in phases. In the first phase, Rome will
generally have the best military. In the second phase, although your
military will normally be better than the enemy, you will meet much
tougher opponents; and if you have grown your empire in the first
phase, you will often be fighting campaigns far away from home. In the
final phase, you can expect your enemies to be as tough as yourself.<br>

<br>
The amount of control and information about the empire is directly
proportional to the cost of the beuracracy. If you choose to have more
control, it will cost you more as a % of total income.<br>
<br>

And now onto the details.<br>

<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">


1: SPQR is based around people, not countries.</span><br>








<br>







On every turn of SPQR, the player plays the part of 1 person in Rome.
Who that actually will be is decided by the player. He may choose a
separate person every turn, but normally the same person is kept until
their death. Therefore the powers available to a player will depend on
who is picked. So maybe you can think of SPQR as a turn based role
playing game.<br>








<br>







Reasoning: We need a way to simulate both the fall of the republic, and
to simulate civil wars. It is typical that a player will always
demand more power, and the only end result of this will give you an
emperor. But this is not forced on the player.<br>







Similarly, in the civil war period, we need a mechanism where a player
can rapidly admit defeat to another Roman power yet continue to play. A
player in a losing position in a civil war will normally switch at some
point to the winning side, rather than run the empire into the ground
to hold on to power.<br>







<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">

2: The basic map unit is the City</span><br>







<br>







Compare cities with countryside:<br>







<br>







Cities:<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have dense populations<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May have harbors<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easier to control<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easier to tax<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promote trade<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, consume food<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow greater goods production<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easier to defend<br>







<br>







Countryside:<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have lower population densities<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost more to control<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Produce lower tax<br>







&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, produce a food surplus<br>







<br>







A city controls a number of hexes around it (this number can vary).
When a city is captured by an enemy unit, then usually the hexes under
it's control will count as being captured as well. It is unusual for
this not to happen, the reasons begin:<br>







<br>







The capture being done by a weak enemy&nbsp;at the very end of a campaign season.<br>







The enemy is weak and hated (barbarian units on plunder missions, for example)<br>







<br>







Even if this happens though, the hexes will offer no opposition&nbsp;to
enemy units passing through them, and, after a year, convert to their
new owner.<br>







<br>







In a civilized area, generally all countryside hexes will be under the
influence of a city. In a barbarian area this is not the case, and all
hexes will be 'free'. Obviously conquering civilized areas will be
potentially a lot faster since all you need to do is capture the
cities; whereas in barbarian areas you will need to capture each hex
individually.<br>







<br>







Cities in general consume food, and their size is mainly limited to the
number of hexes they influence, since these hexes in effect feed the
city. In the time period we are simulating, large scale transportation
of food, other than by boat, was not in general effective, so any
excess food produced by the countryside will be used by the local city
and not move outside the area. The exception with boats is important,
because some cities may grow so large that they need to be supplied
every year with food from far away - Rome being the most obvious city.<br>







<br>







Battles in the countryside are very much the standard type of battle.
Un-walled cities are treated as if there was no city for all military
encounters. Walled cities create a seige situation, and cannot be
assaulted unless the enemy has a seige train. During a seige, a city
does not receive food from it's countryside hexes. It is also possible,
given a navy, to seige from the sea as well, and prevent the import of
food by boat.<br>







<br>







In general, troops produced from the countryside are better than those from the city.<br>







<br>






<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">

3: The basic military unit is the unit (duh!)</span><br>






<br>


A unit is a number of troops from 1 to 20,000. It is unusual for units
to have less than 1,000 troops. Each hex can hold up to 4 units. Each
unit may have up to 8 different unit types. Each type has 2 aspects:
it's troop type, and it's skill. There are many troop types:<br>


<br>


Elephants<br>


Heavy Cavalry<br>


Cavalry<br>


Light Cavalry<br>


Camelry<br>


Expendables<br>


Spears<br>



Pikes<br>


Blades<br>


Warband<br>


Auxilia<br>


Bowmen<br>


Psiloi<br>


Artillery<br>


Hordes<br>


<br>


The various skills are:<br>


<br>


Superior<br>


Ordinary<br>


Inferior<br>


Fast<br>


Exception<br>


<br>


Any particular sub-unit may have one and only one skill, and not all skill type are always available.<br>


<br>


A sub-unit also has a 'Commander' tag as well, which if true means it
is run by an SPQR person. The advantages and disadvantages of SPQR
people commanding units are:<br>



<br>



Positive:<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Campaign season can be extended<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater loyalty<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minor advantage of Republican systems is that the command troops
come at no extra cost, since they are borne by the SPQR person.<br>



<br>



Negative:<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tend to be slightly more costly<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they are controlled by SPQR people, they may be more independent<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals in charge of a unit are those most likely to declare themselves emperor.<br>



<br>



<br>


Each hex can hold
up to 4 units.<br>






<br>






When a unit attacks another unit, the following sequence of events happens:<br>






<br>






Firstly, units on the same hex as the attacker that have movement points left may join in the attack.<br>






<br>






Then the attack is done. The attacker may choose from some options,
i.e. the losses they are prepared to accept, and perhaps what sort of
attack they may try. The defender also chooses from some options. Then
the battle is calculated. The results will be one of: (ranging from
best to worst, from the point of the attacker)<br>






<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1: The defending units surrender before battle starts.<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2: The defending units retreat away from battle<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3: The defending units are annihilated &nbsp;(and the attackers take some loss)<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4: The attacker wins, but takes losses (remaining defenders retreat)<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5: The defender retreats but gives the attacker a bloody nose (a phyrric victory)<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6: Battle is not engaged, and the attackers retreat without loss*<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7: Attackers refuse to move<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8: Defenders win, and force the attackers to retreat with losses<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9: Defenders win, and inflict heavy losses on the retreating attackers<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10: Defenders annihilate the attacking force<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11: Attackers rebel and and switch sides<br>






<br>




* e.g. troops morale is lowered when they discover the enemy well entrenched<br>




<br>







Most of these results will give casualties to both sides. If the
defenders win, then all the units remain in their starting places. If
the attackers win, then they all move to the new hex. In this latter
case, the defenders must retreat 1 hex to another bordering hex that is
either friendly or free of enemy units. If no such hex exists, then
another battle occurs between the two sides (usually with a
large&nbsp;disadvantage to the defenders).<br>






<br>






<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">



4: SPQR is based around people</span><br>






<br>






Real people populate SPQR. They have children and careers. Unfortunately, most of these people will be anonymous, because:<br>






<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are too many, and they die regularly. Most names will mean nothing to you.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help the memory, we use families and awards.<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the middle&nbsp;name denotes the type of person. So, for example,
the name Lucius may denote good &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; military commanders; Grachus
that of republicans. This is a pure game device.<br>






<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">
The yearly turn</span><br>






<br>






A turn is SPQR is one year long. The turn phase runs a strict order, vis:<br>






<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I: Player chooses who to play this year<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II: Spending: excess cash may be spent on special projects at this time<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; III: Pre-campaign movement: players may SR troops<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IV: Campaign season: troops are moved and normal combat occurs.<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V: Post-campaign movement: all troops not SR'd in pre-campaign movement, and all troops who<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did not move in the movement phase can be SR'd.<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VI: Harvest time: Taxes are collected and food levels are set.<br>






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VII: Start of next year: consuls are elected for the new year.<br>






<br>





Let's sub-divide these and give some more detail:<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">I: Player choice</span><br>





<br>





This part is fairly simple. Most moves the player will want to stay
with the same person. Even when they change, most likely they will want
to play a powerful character, and SPQR will happily provide lists of
the most powerful every turn.<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">II: Spending</span><br>





<br>





Excess cash may be spent here. But it's not as simple as just spending
easy money. First let's define cash. This is the gold and silver
reserves of the empire. And 'excess'? Thats any that happens to be any
cash you have! So let's look more closely at how we manage the economy.<br>


<br>


Firstly, there is the income of the economy. Income is derived from
several sources, but by far the most important of these are taxes. It
is important to note that in the Roman period taxes were historically
low, so you may have a 2% tax on slaves, or 5% on money lending. The
next most important source of revenue is the spoils of war, which of course
is highly variable for each year. The next source is that of the gold
and silver mines of the empire. Finally, a minor source of money is by
simply taking it from people. This last would normally be by
confiscating the estates of rich people - which happened on a regular
basis with some emperors! Finally, there is non-direct income, where
the empire will take a resource (say food) and not pay for it.<br>


<br>


Next are the outgoings. By far the biggest outgoing is on the military.
In various order, the other major outgoings are 'bread and circuses',
i.e. entertainment for the people (mainly for the inhabitants of the
city of Rome, it must be said), upkeep of the water and road systems,
and appeasement payments to enemies. Like income, you can have
non-direct spending. The classic example is disaster relief; it was
very common, in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster,
to drop the tax rate to 0% in the area affected. <br>


<br>


There is one more outgoing that is perhaps the most important outgoing,
and one which is perhaps the most interesting: buerocracy.<br>


<br>


Now, income in the manner described above comes in the form of coins,
i.e. shaped nuggets of either copper, silver or gold. The empire
derives an extra bonus in that a coin made of gold is worth slightly
more than that of an equal weight of gold, <span style="font-style: italic;">if the empire is perceived to be honest</span>.
At any time the empire can make quick money by producing coins that
have less silver or gold in them. For example, a sesterci may have 100%
silver; you can make that 80% silver, thus saving you money (since the
sesterci is nominally equal in value to the 100% silver one). However,
your reputation will suffer, and slowly the value of the coin will be
debased (with the main consequence being inflation).<br>


<br>


There is sometimes a good reason why you may choose to debase your
coinage. The empire will depend on a certain amount of coin being
circulated, otherwise transactions will start to be conducted by
bartering, and thus your tax collections may give you goods rather than
the gold and silver which is much easier turned into goods and services
that you require. So a player needs to keep the coinage levels up in
order to make the economy a coin-based one rather than a barter system.
Of course in times of difficulty, the easiest way to produce high coin
levels is to debase the coins.<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">III: Per-Campaign Movement</span><br>





<br>


Units can now move. These moves represent troop movements from the
start of the year to the start of the campaign period, so usually they
are limited to sea
transfers or troop movements in the southern half of the map.<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">IV: Campaign Season</span><br>





<br>


This is one of the most critical sections of the game turn. During this
part, troops move normally and combat is conducted. The first
difficulty is that the campaign season varies according to the
commander and the troops. Highly skilled commanders can start the
season early; and with well trained troops they can carry the season
into late in the year. Such a flexibility can be critical in war.
Campaigns can also cost money, especially if they are not a success.
Although troops may have a seemingly high movement rate at first, in
general they must finish the campaign season in place where they can
rest and be fed. To make life easier, the should somehow display how
many moves are needed to safely retire (or automatically update a
'real-moves-left' move amount).<br>





In general, the further north you are, the shorter the campaign season is.<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">V: Post-Campaign Season</span><br>





<br>





Once again, troops can move. This represents post campaign movement.<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">VI: Harvest Time</span><br>





<br>





This is probably the most important phase of all. Essentially, in this
part you collect your taxes and set some general spending policy for
the next year.<br>


<br>


To stop that being so vague, let me specify. In this section, the game
first calculates the income this turn. The game also calculates income
at the start of the 'spending' season, but it is normally much less
than this period, because you are collecting taxes from harvest (a lot)
and campaign windfalls with be added here (which can be a lot). Of the
other income streams, gold and silver mines are calculated each time,
whilst confisticating estates is different for each turn. The end
result is almost always: more income this time, and pressure to steal
estates when money is needed on the other financial turn.<br>


<br>


Next you can set the tax rates for the coming year. The Roman <br>

&nbsp;is not effeicent enough to allow you to change the tax rate
(although this could be an option if the empire leans heavily in one
direction: this may change). The usual expense is 10% of total spending
spread over both financial periods (so an unfair proportion is spent in
the first). the twist is: <span style="font-style: italic;">the greater control you desire over your domain, the higher this cost</span>. Of course the opposite is also true: <span style="font-style: italic;">the more control you relax, the cheaper it is to run it!</span> This aspect is covered in a later section.<br>





<br>





<span style="font-weight: bold;">VII: Consul Elections</span><br>





<br>





Consuls and other officials are set in place.<br>





<br>


<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
SPQR People</span><br>


<br>


The people populating the game have various attributes:<br>


<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Name</span><br>


Obviously a simple text string<br>


<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Desire</span><br>

What they wish to be: a soldier, an emperor, a diplomat, or a
politician. The desire to be an emperor is at first not used. When
individuals are given dictator status in a republic then that desire
may be awakened. After a succesfull emperor, all individuals may have
this desire.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Skill</span><br>


What they are best at: soldiering, leading, diplomacy or politics.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Wisdom</span><br>

Wisdom denotes a persons rationale skill in calculating the best
situation for themselves. It increases slightly every 5 years, and at a
certain level a persons desire is set equal to their skill (i.e., they
work out what they are best at). This minor effect makes elder people a
lot more reliable (since they obviously have skills in what they are
interested in doing).<br>


<br style="font-style: italic;">


<span style="font-style: italic;">Intelligence</span><br>


Intelligence denotes a persons skill in calculating how best to so
something. As compared to wisdom, a person with high wisdom is good at
questions like 'how do I conquer empire XXX' wheras one with high
intelligence is good at 'How do win this battle?'. In game terms,
wisdom is used at the start of every turn (what goals shall I aim for&nbsp;now?)
whereas intelligence is used all other times (battles, voting and so
on - how do I acheive my goal).<br>


<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Charisma</span><br>

Charisma represents a persons likeability and leadership qualities.<br>

<br>


<span style="font-style: italic;">Constitution</span><br>

Governs the health and vitality of the person. This only has a small
bearing on the length of the life; it is mainly used to see how well
somebody can hold up against long travelling or long campaign seasons.<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Beauracracy</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>

SPQR will essentially hide a lot of details of the economics and
military from you. You can get more data and more options by increasing
the beauracracy. This insidious charge is not a fixed sum but instead
expressed as a percentage charge of total income. Normally it is around
10%, but it can increase to astounding amounts if you choose to enforce
real micro-managment of everybodys lives (and presumably annoy them a
lot as well).<br>

<br>
One small point to know is that beauracracy costs are not applied to
windfall incomes from conquest, since these require no actual
beauracracy to acquire (just an army!).<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventions &amp; Engineering</span><br>
