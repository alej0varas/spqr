  Treatise on isoperimetrical figures.

Hipparchus (160 B.C. - 120 B.C. at earliest)
  Lived at Rhodes. Great astronomer who calculated moon and planatary motions.

Hero (100? B.C. - 30? B.C.)
  Alexandrian. Geometry, volumes, weights and measures, hydraulic machines and
  clyclometers. Invented the steam engine.

Theodosius (1st Century B.C.)
  Geometry of the sphere.

Dionysodorus (1st Century B.C.)
  Solution to divide a hemisphere by a plane parallel to its base into two

Theon (~370 A.D.)
  A commentary on the Almagest.

Hypatia (?? - 415 A.D., daughter of Theon)
