# main game scenario for spqr
# comments are like this, obviously

# this is the debug file used for testing

	(Romans)

# then the enemy ones:

# next come the roman soldiers:
# the 4th line is as follows: (X,Y,Z), where x is the % unit strength,
# Y is the troop quality (1-5) and Z is the morale (1-5), where low is best

# here is where we test by having 1 unit on another
